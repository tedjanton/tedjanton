### Hi there 👋
My name is Ted Anton, and I'm former musician and marketer turned software engineer that is probably a little too obsessed with his cats. I get the same addictive feeling of joy and excitement that I used to get after a great performance on stage playing the flute as I do when I solve a really tough coding problem or implement something I’ve never done before. And that alone tells me I’m meant to be a software engineer.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a full-stack Spotify clone that includes music videos
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his (but honestly, you can call me whatever you fancy)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was almost a professional bowler at the age of 10

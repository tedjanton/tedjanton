### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ted Anton, and I'm a musician and marketer turned software engineer that is probably a little too obsessed with his cats. I get the same addictive feeling of joy and excitement that I used to get after a great performance on stage playing the flute as I do when I solve a really tough coding problem or implement something Iâ€™ve never done before. And that alone tells me Iâ€™m meant to be a software engineer.

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on a full-stack Spotify clone that includes music videos
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning Python
- ðŸ˜„  Pronouns: he/him/his (but honestly, you can call me whatever you fancy)
- ðŸ‘¯  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any new and exciting project!
- ðŸ’¬  Ask me about my journey as a software engineer, classical flutist, or marketer
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was almost a professional bowler at the age of 10
